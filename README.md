## Limitations

- **Rate Limits**: SE Ranking API has rate limits (varies by plan)
- **Regional Data**: Some data is region-specific (requires country code)
- **Keyword Limits**: Export Metrics supports up to 700 keywords per request
- **Historical Data**: History trend data adds to response time
- **API Credits**: Some operations consume API credits (check your plan)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Errors

**Problem**: "401 Unauthorized" or "Invalid API Token"

**Solution**:

1. Verify API token is correct (copy from SE Ranking dashboard)
2. Ensure API Type is set to "Data API"
3. Check token hasn't expired
4. Regenerate token in SE Ranking dashboard if needed
5. Test credentials using the "Test" button in n8n

---

### Invalid Source/Country Code

**Problem**: "Invalid source" or "400 Bad Request"

**Solution**:

1. Use correct Alpha-2 country codes: `us`, `uk`, `de`, `fr`, `es`, `it`, `ca`, `au`, `pl`
2. Country code must be lowercase
3. Check if SE Ranking has data for that region
4. Some engines/features may not be available in all regions

---

### Domain Format Errors

**Problem**: "Invalid domain format" or "Domain validation failed"

**Solution**:

1. Remove `http://` or `https://` from domain (unless operation specifies full URL)
2. Remove `www.` prefix
3. Remove trailing slashes
4. Use format: `example.com` not `www.example.com/`
5. For subdomains: `blog.example.com` is valid

**Valid formats:**

- ✅ `example.com`
- ✅ `blog.example.com`
- ✅ `example.co.uk`
- ❌ `https://example.com`
- ❌ `www.example.com`
- ❌ `example.com/`

---

### Empty Results

**Problem**: No data returned from API

**Solution**:

1. Verify domain has data in SE Ranking database
2. Check if domain is indexed/tracked
3. Try different source/region (domain may rank elsewhere)
4. Adjust filters - they may be too restrictive
5. For new domains, wait 24-48 hours for initial data collection
6. Check if keyword has search volume in selected region

---

### Timeout Errors

**Problem**: "Request timeout" or "Operation exceeded time limit"

**Solution**:

1. Reduce `limit` parameter (try 100 instead of 1000)
2. Use pagination with `offset` to fetch data in chunks
3. For keyword export, reduce number of keywords (try 100 instead of 700)
4. Remove `history_trend` parameter if not needed (adds processing time)
5. Use "Get Worldwide Aggregate" instead of getting all regional databases

---

### Too Many Keywords Error

**Problem**: "Too many keywords" or "Maximum 700 keywords exceeded"

**Solution**:

1. Split keyword list into batches of 700 or less
2. Use multiple node executions with different batches
3. Consider using keyword suggestion operations first to narrow down list

---

### Rate Limit Errors

**Problem**: "429 Too Many Requests" or "Rate limit exceeded"

**Solution**:

1. Add delay between requests using n8n Wait node
2. Reduce frequency of scheduled workflows
3. Use batch operations instead of individual requests
4. Upgrade SE Ranking plan for higher rate limits
5. Implement exponential backoff retry logic

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Efficient Data Retrieval

✅ **DO:**

- Use "Get Worldwide Aggregate" for quick domain overview
- Use pagination for large datasets (limit: 100-500)
- Cache frequently accessed data
- Use filters to reduce result size

❌ **DON'T:**

- Request all databases when you only need one region
- Fetch 10,000 keywords at once without pagination
- Request history_trend unless specifically needed

### 2. Keyword Research

✅ **DO:**

- Start with similar keywords, then expand to related/questions
- Use filters to focus on achievable opportunities (difficulty < 50)
- Export metrics in batches of 200-500 keywords
- Include multiple keyword types for comprehensive research

❌ **DON'T:**

- Request all keyword types simultaneously without filtering
- Ignore difficulty scores (targeting too-hard keywords wastes effort)
- Forget to check search intent and relevance

### 3. Backlink Monitoring

✅ **DO:**

- Schedule daily checks for new/lost backlinks
- Use "Get Summary" for quick health checks
- Export full data monthly for archival
- Track Domain InLink Rank trends over time
- Monitor anchor text distribution for natural link profile

❌ **DON'T:**

- Poll "Get All Backlinks" every hour (use history endpoints)
- Download exports without checking status first
- Ignore referring domain diversity (IP distribution)

### 4. Competitor Analysis

✅ **DO:**

- Use "Get Competitors" to identify relevant competitors first
- Track competitor changes over time (weekly/monthly)
- Focus on keywords where competitors rank in top 20
- Analyze multiple competitors to find patterns

❌ **DON'T:**

- Compare against irrelevant competitors
- Track too many competitors (focus on top 5-10)
- Ignore competitor's content strategy and backlink profile

### 5. AI Search Optimization

✅ **DO:**

- Monitor multiple engines (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini)
- Track brand mentions and citation types
- Focus on high-volume prompts
- Use base_domain scope for brand monitoring

❌ **DON'T:**

- Only track one LLM engine
- Ignore prompt context and user intent
- Forget to optimize content based on insights

### 6. Website Auditing

✅ **DO:**

- Use Advanced Audit for JavaScript-heavy sites (React, Vue, Angular)
- Set realistic max_pages based on site size
- Schedule monthly audits for ongoing monitoring
- Compare historical audits to track improvements
- Export issues to spreadsheet for team collaboration

❌ **DON'T:**

- Set max_pages too high (start with 1000-5000)
- Ignore robots.txt unless intentionally testing blocked areas
- Run audits too frequently (daily audits waste credits)

### 7. Error Handling

✅ **DO:**

- Implement retry logic for transient errors
- Log errors for debugging
- Use n8n's "Continue on Fail" for batch operations
- Validate input before API calls

❌ **DON'T:**

- Ignore error messages (they contain helpful hints)
- Retry immediately after rate limit (wait 60s)
- Skip input validation
